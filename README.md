## Objective 

To explore the implementation of nucleotide data into a neural network. 

## The data

The data is located on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X). Please use `data/3.species_24_only_07March2018`

## To do 

- [ ] Get data into one hot encoding format
	- [ ] classification 1: binary (presence or absence of GAL4 signal)
	- [ ] classification 2: classification of stage of signal 
- [ ] Explore other options for data structuring of nucleotide data beyond one hot encoding
- [ ] Run preliminary Network. What is the accuracy?
- [ ] Identify network archetecture, which layers?
- [ ] Address areas of optimization

## Key points to keep in mind

- Structual organization of nucleotide input must be upheld.  

## Platforms

Main Language: Python
Implementation: TensorFlow, Keras
