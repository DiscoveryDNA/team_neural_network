## Objective 

To explore the implementation of nucleotide data into a neural network. 

## To do 

**Priority Items**
-  [ ] Make subsets of sequences to do diagnostics on
-  [ ] Diagnostics: Build nueral network and run
	- [ ] try a few different Architectures, no more than three layers
	- [ ] assess time on different number of subsets, quantify and visualize
	- [ ] assess memory on different number of subsets, quantify and visualize
	
**Other**
- [ ] Explore other options for data structuring of nucleotide data beyond one hot encoding 
	- [ ] read section 2.2 in Deep Learning in Python
	- [ ] Make notes on what you are thinking and upload to [notes.md]()
- [ ] Identify network Architecture, which layers?
	- [ ]  What sort of layers and in which confirmation are we going to use?
- [x] Get data into one hot encoding format
	- [x] classification 1: binary (presence or absence of GAL4 signal)
	- [x] classification 2: classification of stage of signal
	
## The data

The data is located on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X). Please use `data/3.species_24_only_07March2018`

## Key points to keep in mind

- Structual organization of nucleotide input must be upheld.  

## Platforms

Main Language: Python
Implementation: TensorFlow, Keras
