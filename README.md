**Previous**: Tianhao Zang

## Objective 

To explore the implementation of nucleotide data into a neural network. 

## The data

The data is located on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X). Please use `data/3.species_24_only_07March2018`

## Key points to keep in mind

- Structual organization of nucleotide input must be upheld.  

## Platforms

Main Language: Python
Implementation: TensorFlow, Keras

## Data Management

- See [`data_management.md`](https://github.com/DiscoveryDNA/team_neural_network/blob/master/data_managment.md)
