# Neural Network Team

This is the home repo for the Neural Network team. 

## Team Members

Adam Stafford, Tianhao Zang

## Objective 

To explore the implementation of nucleotide data into a neural network. 

## The data

The data is located on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X). Please use `data/3.species_24_only_07March2018`

## To do 

- [ ] Get data into one hot encoding format
	- [ ] classification 1: binary (presence or absence of GAL4 signal)
	- [ ] classification 2: classification of stage of signal 
- [ ] Explore other options for data structuring of nucleotide data beyond one hot encoding
- [ ] Run preliminary Network. What is the accuracy?
- [ ] Identify network archetecture, which layers?
- [ ] Address areas of optimization

## Key points to keep in mind

- Structual organization of nucleotide input must be upheld.  

## Platforms

Main Language: Python
Implementation: TensorFlow, Keras

## Data Management

1. All output data is kept in `data/output` and tagged with date of creation. 
2. Notes on background are kept in team repo in the wiki
3. Scripts that are run sequentially are numbered accordingly
5. Use underscores for spaces in file and folder naming
6. Keep data over 100MB in [Google Drive DiscoveryDNA_shared_data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kAh9NPg0gin4KIYvdz2Czi1LCQ2Js06X)
7. Update README with vital information about repo or directory
