This folder contains files that serve as utilities to complete certain tasks. Their purposes are detailed below.

---

**1a. Producing one-hot encoded output with motifs attached from raw data:**

[producing_output_files_with_motif.ipynb](producing_output_files_with_motif.ipynb)

---

**1b. Producing one-hot encoded output from raw data without any motif attached:**

[producing_output_files_without_motif.ipynb](producing_output_files_without_motif.ipynb)

---

**2. Saving all one-hot encoded output files in a folder as a single list buffer to speed up model training process:**

[producing_buffer_from_output.ipynb](producing_buffer_from_output.ipynb)

---

**3. Producing random subsets of outputs to speed up training time and save money:**

[selecting_subsets.ipynb](selecting_subsets.ipynb)

---

**4. Generating random pseudo-dna-sequence:**

[random_sequence_generator.ipynb](random_sequence_generator.ipynb)
